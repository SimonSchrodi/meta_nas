"""
Your submission must contain a class NAS that has a `search` method. The arguments
we'll pass and the output we'll expect are detailed below, but beyond that you can
do whatever you want within the class. Feel free to add other python files that are
imported, as long as you bundle them into the submission zip and they are imported when
`import nas` is called.

For information, you can check out the ingestion program to see exactly how we'll interact 
with this class. To submit, zip this file and any helpers files together with the dataset_metadata file
 and upload it to the CodaLab page.
